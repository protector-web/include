The best source for this would probably be Dell customer service or sales support. Companies are usually happy to provide information to customers, especially if it might improve odds of a sale. It might even be in a faq area on their web site. On Super User, though, it would be random chance that anyone would happen to know. It's attracted a close vote as off-topic, and the question is sort of at the edge of topicality. –
